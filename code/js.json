  "content":"<h1>What is JavaScript?</h1><p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as \"JS\", is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted run-time language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon objects made available by the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>"
